 *  virtualcar is a vehicle computer-powered system engine written in C to 
 *  help you research and learn more about vehicle devices and CAN protocol.
 *  This project represents a central unit or the CAN Bus, along with several
 *  different nodes that transmit and analyze signals.
 *
 *  The purpose of this code and the project is to replace paid alternatives
 *  and allow others to learn more about vehicle embedded systems.
 *
 *  The project is developed in C and it's based on a SocketCAN which is 
 *  available in any modern Linux kernel.
